= Major migrations made easy with OpenRewrite

[quote, Introduction to OpenRewrite, https://docs.openrewrite.org]
____
OpenRewrite enables large-scale distributed source code refactoring for framework migrations, vulnerability patches, and API migrations with an early focus on the Java language.
____

To demonstrate OpenRewrite, this blogpost will walk through upgrading a Spring Boot 1.5 application to 2.5+.
Along the way we will pick up JUnit 5, and migrate from Java 8 to 17, with minimal manual intervention.

We'll start with the Spring PetClinic Sample Application, back as it was almost five years ago in 2017!
You can follow along by copy-pasting the commands and viewing the changes made in each step.
You'll need git, patch and
https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!], to easily switch between Java versions.
Be sure to commit your changes after each command to get a clean diff of changes at each step.

== Checkout Spring PetClinic 1.5.x
Start by checking out the relevant branch of Spring PetClinic locally.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git;
cd spring-petclinic;
git checkout -b 1.5.x;
----

=== SDKMAN!
[quote, The Software Development Kit Manager, https://sdkman.io]
____
https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!] is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems.
It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. 
____
Through SDKMAN! we'll install and switch between the Java versions used in this blogpost.
Start by installing recent versions of Java 8 and 17, and activate Java 8.
[source,bash]
----
# curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install java 8.0.322-tem
sdk install java 17.0.2-tem
sdk use java 8.0.322-tem
----
Keep the terminal window open to stay on Java 8.
Or add a `.sdkmanrc` file containing `java=8.0.322-tem` inside `spring-petclinic/`,
https://sdkman.io/usage#env[to switch automatically each time you enter the project folder].

=== Apache Maven wrapper
Next up we'll switch out the almost 7 years old Takari Maven Wrapper 3.3.3 for the most recent Apache Maven Wrapper version 3.8.5.
This ensures there's no incompatibilities running more recent plugins and Java versions.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.8.5
----

=== Verify
At any step in the migration we can verify our setup produces a working build by invoking the Maven verify goal.
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----
NOTE: We need neither `clean` nor `install` when using well behaved plugins.

This should produce a working build when run with Java 8.
Runs with Java 17 fail for now; we'll get to those later.

== Upgrade to JUnit 5
To gain confidence with OpenRewrite, we'll first try to migrate our application from JUnit 4 to 5.
JUnit 5 was released in September 2017, yet it's all too common to still see JUnit 4 on existing projects.

Take a moment to think about what would be needed for a JUnit 4 to 5 migration;
we will need to add new dependencies, remove old dependencies, update imports, occasionally swap argument orders in assertions, before getting into more complicated patterns such as replacing `@Rule` usage.
It should become apparent that while some steps could be achieved with a search-and-replace operation, others are not as clear cut.

Let's get OpenRewrite set up to apply our first automated migration:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:4.21.0:init \ # <1>
  -Ddependencies=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-testing-frameworks:1.19.0 \ # <2>
  -DactiveRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.JUnit5BestPractices # <3>

<2> We add a dependency on
https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks[rewrite-testing-frameworks] to the plugin.
<3> We activate
https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/blob/v1.19.0/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/junit5.yml#L18[the JUnit5BestPractices recipe].
<4> The diff should show the plugin added to the project

If you take a closer look at the added
https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/blob/v1.19.0/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/junit5.yml#L18[JUnit5BestPractices recipe],
you'll find it's composed of a `recipeList`, with references defined further down.
Note how
https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/blob/v1.19.0/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/junit5.yml#L46[the `recipeList` under `JUnit4to5Migration`] matches some of the migration steps we identified above.
This is a common pattern with OpenRewrite recipes; complex migrations are composed of more fine grained recipes, each of which applies a small step in the full migration.

=== Run JUnit 5 migration
With the plugin configured, next comes running OpenRewrite.
Notice how we can use the shorthand `rewrite` to invoke Maven plugin goals once the plugin is added to the project `pom.xml`.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw rewrite:run
----

This command should complete in about a minute, and migrate all tests to JUnit 5, as well as updating the `pom.xml`.
While most tests in the Spring PetClinic are fairly straightforward, the changes in `PetTypeFormatterTests` highlight a few strengths of OpenRewrite.
Notice how it updates not just the imports and `@Test` annotations, but also method visibility, applies `MockitoExtension` and adopts `assertThrows`.

----

Now unfortunately this migration does not yet lead to a working build, due to a Spring Boot incompatibility.
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.2-Release-Notes#junit-5[JUnit 5 support was added in Spring Boot 2.2], while
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.4-Release-Notes[JUnit 5â€™s Vintage Engine was dropped in Spring Boot 2.4].

So let's revert this partial JUnit 5 migration for now, as it will be picked (correctly) up as part of the Spring Boot migration.

[source,bash]
----
git reset --hard
----

== Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.x
To upgrade Spring Boot applications we need a different dependency and recipe.
We invoke the rewrite plugin `configure` goal for the plugin to update it's own configuration. Neat!

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw rewrite:configure \
  -Ddependencies=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:4.19.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -DactiveRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.SpringBoot1To2Migration
----

NOTE: The `configure` goal only works if the plugin is already present; if not replace `rewrite:configure` with `org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:4.21.0:init`.

We can again see how the
https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring/blob/v4.18.0/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/spring-boot2.yml[SpringBoot1To2Migration] is composed of finer grained recipes.
If you look closely these migration takes us first to 2.0.x, then 2.1.x, 2.2.x, all the way through to 2.5.x at present, with 2.6.x still in development.
As indicated above a JUnit 5 migration will be executed as part of the Spring Boot 2.4.x migration.

We again run OpenRewrite to upgrade our application.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw rewrite:run
----

This results in a large changeset, with notable changes to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and `pom.xml`, and relatively small changes in `src/main/java`.
The same test changes that we saw before with the isolated migration to JUnit 5 are again present.

=== Verify & fix tests
The big change now is that we can once again run our build, with a small caveat.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----

Two tests fail after the migration to Spring Boot 2.5.x.

  [INFO] Results:
  [INFO] 
  [ERROR] Failures: 
  [ERROR]   ValidatorTests.shouldNotValidateWhenFirstNameEmpty:42 
  expected: "may not be empty"
  but was : "must not be empty"
  [ERROR]   VetControllerTests.testShowResourcesVetList:67 Content type
  expected: <application/json;charset=UTF-8>
  but was: <application/json>
  [INFO] 
  [ERROR] Tests run: 41, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1

The `ValidatorTests.shouldNotValidateWhenFirstNameEmpty` failure is caused by a change in the validation implementation.
The `VetControllerTests.testShowResourcesVetList` failure is caused by a change in the returned media type.
Both tests are easily fixed with small patch command.

----

When we now run the tests again, all tests will pass.
That means our migration to Spring Boot 2.5 and JUnit 5 worked!

== Upgrade to Java 17
Next we want to adopt the Java 17 runtime, for whch we need yet another dependency and recipe.
We will run the
https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-migrate-java/blob/main/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/java8-to-java11.yml#L18[Java8toJava11] recipe, which comprises a number of fixes to be compatible with Java 11 runtime.
There's no need for a recipe yet to explicitly upgrade to Java 17.

=== Upgrade Wro4j and replace Cobertura with JaCoCo
The build still uses problematic old versions of
https://github.com/wro4j/wro4j[`wro4j`] and http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/[Cobertura].
The former we can upgrade, but the latter we can best replace with the more modern
https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/[JaCoCo].
We cheat just a little bit by cherry picking out of the main branch, after which we patch both `wro4j` and `JaCoCo`.

That's enough to resolve our build issues; we're now compatible with the Java 17 runtime.
Our source level is still at 1.8 though, so we can not yet use any new language feautures.

=== Patch java.version
To update the source level we override the `java.version` property
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/2.6.x/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-parent/build.gradle#L22[defined in the Spring Boot parent `pom.xml`].
That sets both `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` to use Java 17 as well, unlocking new language features such as text blocks and records.

Now we are able to start using new language features in our updated Spring PetClinic application.

== Cleanup 
When we take a closer look through the application source code, we notice there's quite a few unnecessary imports.
Luckily OpenRewrite also contains a large number of clean up recipes that we can use.
The 
https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/removeunusedimports[RemoveUnusedImports] recipe in particular comes in handy here.

CAUTION: Be aware that OpenRewrite presently requires access to Java compiler internals to function.
On JDK 17+ you can opt-in to access these internals via
https://docs.openrewrite.org/getting-started/getting-started#running-on-jdk-16-and-newer[`--add-exports` in a number ways].
Adding --ad-exports statements to `.mvn/jvm.config` is by far the easiest way to set these parameters.

Reconfigure the plugin to activate and run this new recipe;
This recipe does not need any additional dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw rewrite:configure \
  -DactiveRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.RemoveUnusedImports
./mvnw rewrite:run
----

That concludes the Java recipes we will run against the Spring PetClinic for now.
But there's a host of other recipes to explore still;
https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java[look at the Java collection of recipes] to see which might be applicable to your projects.

Also know OpenRewrite is not limited to Java; you can also explore recipes for related technology such as Maven, Gradle, XML, YAML, JSON, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes and more.

=== Remove plugin
Once we're done migrating our application, we can have the OpenRewrite Maven plugin remove itself from our `pom.xml`.
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw rewrite:remove
----
That concludes our first look at OpenRewrite.
Be sure to reach out if you encounter any issues; I've found the folks behind OpenRewrite are _very_ responsive with any issues.
